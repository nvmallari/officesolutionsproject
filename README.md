# Introduction
Introduction is like a summary. It shouldn't be too long as we don't want to read an essay on a project. We should describe in an interesting manner what's the project aim, and what problems does a given application solve. Two or three sentences are enough in case of a small project.

If it's a training project, mention your incentive. Why did you want to create it? To learn a particular technology? Was it a hackathon project? Was it for a non-profit organization? Is it an application created to memorize the material from workshops or and online course? It's worth mentioning here, without a doubt.

"officesolutionsproject" is a class project intended to complete for a Management Information Systems course at San Jose State University. The purpose of this project is to learn how to present data-backed business recommendations and actionables through a coded project. The project poses as an office supply retailer that ships furniture, pens, technology, etc. to consumers and corporations and requires the student to utilize collected data and gather useful information.
